//Exercise 1.17: What happens in the program presented in this section if the
//input values are all equal? What if there are no duplicated values?

// Answer:
// If values are all equal, nothing will happen until we input something different,
// because we are only printing something if the current value is not the same.
// If there are no duplicated values, the values are printed as all having occurred 1 time.
